# Introduction
Ads Click Through Rate (CTR) is a significant metric for marketers, representing the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. Analyzing CTR helps companies identify the most effective ads for their target audience, enabling them to optimize their advertising strategies.

In this project, we focus on Ads Click Through Rate Prediction. The objective is to predict whether a user will click on a particular ad based on various features such as daily time spent on the site, age, area income, daily internet usage, gender, etc. We'll train machine learning models to find relationships between user characteristics and ad clicks.

# Click Through Case Study and Rate Analysis
Click-through rate (CTR) is the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. Mathematically, CTR is calculated as follows:

CTR = (Number of Clicks) / (Number of Impressions)

Analyzing the click-through rate helps businesses identify the types of users most likely to click on their advertisements, providing validation for their advertising strategies. Let's analyze the click-through rate based on various user characteristics:

# User Characteristics:
Daily Time Spent on Site: The daily duration of the user's visit to the website.
Age: The age of the user.
Area Income: The average income in the area of the user.
Daily Internet Usage: The daily internet usage of the user.
Ad Topic Line: The title of the ad.
City: The city of the user.
Gender: The gender of the user.
Country: The country of the user.
Timestamp: The time when the user visited the website.
Clicked on Ad: 1 if the user clicked on the ad, otherwise 0.
# Insights:
Users who spend more time on the website tend to click more on ads.
Users with high internet usage click less on ads compared to users with low internet usage.
Users around 40 years old click more on ads compared to users around 27-36 years old.
There's not much difference, but people from high-income areas click less on ads.
